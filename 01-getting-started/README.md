## 01 Getting Started

> ### A Note on ES2015/ES6
>
> I've used the ES6 `const` declaration for constant references,
> rather than `var`.
> Depending on your node.js version, you may need to change this to `var`,
> or run node with the `--harmony` flag.
> Since Node.js 4.x, all shipping features which V8 considers stable
> are turned on by default and don't need a runtime flag.
